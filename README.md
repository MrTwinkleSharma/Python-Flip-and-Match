# Python-Flip-and-Match
### This is a very basic Game based on pygame library in python
For this first of all, I downloaded some images of animals to be matched from **Kenny.nl** a website for game assets.
Steps to Create it.
1. Creating 3 Python (.py) files, one for main game logic **game.py**, then a game configuration file **game_config.py** which will have all the configuration and constant values used for game, and lastly a custom class of animals **animals.py**

2. Now as all the Games this will also have a game loop which will continue as condition described and stops when user explicitly did something to stop it.
so this loop will have a logic to take user input and react differently on that input to update the game state and display

3. After this we'll create a game configuration just to set the variables

4. Using image blit and flip method to display image

5. Creating a custom Animal class in a way such that each objet will have the index and name of animal associated with it

6. Creating a code for main file **game.py** with different modifications.
