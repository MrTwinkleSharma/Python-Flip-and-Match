# Python-Flip-and-Match
### This is a very basic Game based on pygame library in python
For this first of all, I downloaded some images of animals to be matched from **Kenny.nl** a website for game assets.
Steps to Create it.
1. Creating 3 Python (.py) files, one for main game logic **game.py**, then a game configuration file **game_config.py** which will have all the configuration and constant values used for game, and lastly a custom class of animals **animals.py**
